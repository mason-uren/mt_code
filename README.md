# Fiducial Detection and Tracking
Note: this README is not meant to be comprehensive but to highlight the achievements

## Goal

Develop fiducial tracking software, using tracking-by-detection techniques, capable of locating "marked" objects across large scenes, at range. Targets shall be tracked using high-resolution optical sensors, mounted to robotic arms (6DOF), with millimeter certainty of real world fiducial locationization. Tracked targets shall be shared between multiple optical sensors throughout enviroment, thus sensor extrinsics are need to tranlated shared localizations.
