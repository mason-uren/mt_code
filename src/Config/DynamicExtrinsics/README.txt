Calibrated Dynamic Extrinsics models (the "CAD models") are placed in here
separated by the cameras (Ximea id0 vs Ximea id1, etc, and Imperx).

Under each directories here, we should have subdirs for each cad-model (JSON)
file we save here, with the subdir named by date e.g., 2020-07-01-cad-model,
with the json file we also should have a README with description how the
calibration was done and pointer to the data sets,etc.
